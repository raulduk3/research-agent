# Contributor instructions

These instructions apply to every contributor, human or automated. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the working policy they summarize; where the two differ, `CONTRIBUTING.md` wins.

## Build and test

Bun, pinned in `package.json` and CI. Where another tool shadows the pinned Bun, invoke `~/.bun/bin/bun` directly.

| Task         | Command                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install      | `bun install --frozen-lockfile`                             |
| Typecheck    | `bun run typecheck`                                         |
| Lint         | `bun run lint`                                              |
| Format       | `bun run format` to write, `bun run format:check` to verify |
| Full check   | `bun run check`                                             |
| Focused test | `bun test tests/<area>/<name>.test.ts`                      |

`bun run check` runs typecheck, lint, format, the commit and source hygiene check, and the test suite. It must pass on the head of every pull request; CI runs the same commands.

## Change rules

- One change, one branch cut from `develop`, one pull request to `develop`. Branch name `type/short-description`. No stacked pull requests: a change that depends on another waits for it to merge, then cuts from `develop`.
- Make the smallest coherent change that completes the request.
- Code, tests, and the documentation the change affects ship in the same pull request.
- Read the code you are changing and its tests before editing.
- Prefer editing an existing owner over adding a parallel one. No speculative abstractions.
- Tests detect a concrete prohibited alternative. Do not mock away the owner under test.
- Stage only the files that belong to the change. Preserve unrelated uncommitted work.
- The pull request description follows `.github/pull_request_template.md` and is the record of the change.

## Commit format

`type(scope): summary`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`. Subject under 72 characters, imperative, no trailing period. The body explains why. `Closes #N` links the issue. `!` after the type, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, marks a major change.

Commits and changed source lines describe the software, not the process that produced it: no names of people, tools, models, sessions or run identifiers, and no work-tracking labels. Reference issues and pull requests by number. `scripts/checks/hygiene.ts` enforces this in `bun run check`.

Co-author trailers are allowed in the form `Co-authored-by: Name <address>`, with a noreply address only.

## Never

- Push to `develop` or `main`.
- Merge a pull request, or approve your own work.
- Deploy, publish, rotate a credential or restart a service without the owner's explicit instruction in the current session.
- Amend, rebase, reset or force-push a commit that has been pushed for review.
- Touch another branch's worktree: never reset, clean or delete it.
- Put a credential in source, documentation, prompts, commands, fixtures, logs or commit messages.

## Contracts

- `README.md` says what the software is and how to run it.
- `docs/` holds the contracts; `docs/decisions/` holds accepted decisions as records.
- GitHub issues hold every open decision and known deviation, cited by number.

If code and contract disagree, say so with evidence and fix the one that is wrong. Do not improvise a local workaround.

## Scope freezes

None. A new feature needs the owner's decision on a GitHub issue before a branch is cut.

## Precedence

If a prompt, tool or automation conflicts with this file or `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the repository wins.
